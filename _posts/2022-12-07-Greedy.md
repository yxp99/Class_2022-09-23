## Definition

A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. Greedy algorithms are quite successful in some problems, such as Huffman encoding which is used to compress data, or Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path through a graph.


## Problems

55, 45, 763, 621, 122

Amazon top 50: 1648, 767, 1864

## Limitation

- [Not always optimal](https://brilliant.org/wiki/greedy-algorithm/#:~:text=A%20greedy%20algorithm%20is%20a,to%20solve%20the%20entire%20problem.)

## 总结

这部分难题没什么规律. 需要一些奇思妙想, 不建议刷了. 至少本人目前没有看出任何规律. 如果面特定公司刷一下相应的高频即可.
