## Principles

- Amazon Principles

## Star Template

- [star](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/in-person-interview)

The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of what you're describing. Here’s what it looks like:

 
### SITUATION

Describe the situation that you were in, or the task that you needed to accomplish. Give enough detail for the interviewer to understand the complexities of the situation. This example can be from a previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or any relevant event.

 
### TASK

What goal were you working toward?

 
### ACTION

Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail, and keep the focus on you. What specific steps did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project. Let us know what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we,” when describing actions.

 
### RESULT

Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Provide examples using metrics or data if applicable.

## Sample Response

### Challenge (take new project)

- Situation

	When I did the internship in Amfam, a work **colleague left unexpectedly**. He had been responsible for a project for a long time. 

- Task

	My supervisor asked for a volunteer to take ownership of the project, and I decided to take it. To be honest, **I prefer to work under pressure** and saw this as an opportunity to help out the company in their hour of need. 

- Action

1. After taking the project, I **read through the project plan** and user requirements. Although the **timeline was really tight**, I realized that we could still catch up and finish this project on time. During our scrum meeting, I pointed out that to catch up the deadline, we should **focus on the primary functions of this program** and put the most important needs in the priority. I created **a new plan** based on our situation. I also **break the whole development timeline into several parts** and set up deadline for each one of them. With my plan, I delivered the project successfully within the budge of time. 

2. After taking the project, I realized the **backend technology he used was outdated**, and couldn't handle large requests. I **read through the project thoroughly and then created a project plan**. I decided to use Google Firebase as our backend server, and I persuaded my manager to use it. With the efforts I made, I **delivered the project within the budget on time**. 

- Result

	My supervisor was **satisfied** with my work and effort, and **appreciated my commitment** to deliver this important project on time.
